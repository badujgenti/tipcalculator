Tip calculator app


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this .

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge is was build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person


**It's just a start** ðŸš€
